# CSSoB
Checks the state of the bugs that are associated to crash signatures in crash-stats.mozilla.com top crasher lists and search results.

Open bugs get colour-coded depending on their activity level:
* green = last changed in the past week
* yellow = last changed in the past month
* red= last changed over a month ago

For closed bugs their resolution is displayed instead of the bug number, fixed bugs also contain their milestone or if they got uplifted between the current release and Nightly.
Bugs that are incomplete or WFM are hidden from lists.
